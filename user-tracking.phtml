<hr>
<p><? PutLibPhotoRandom($ini,$db_link,"right"); ?>None of the code I'm using on this site performs any user tracking unless the user
specifically opts to be tracked.&nbsp  (My hosting service, <a href=http://www.phpwebhosting.com>phpwebhosting.com</a>, may
track your visit, however.&nbsp If you're concerned about that you should check their <a href=http://www.phpwebhosting.com/priv.html>Privacy
Statement</a>.)</p>
<p>The advantage to being tracked is that the site can tell which photographs have been added or updated since your last
visit.</p>
<h3>Your ID string</h3>
<p>You can specify any text that you like as your Site ID String.&nbsp I recommend you use your full name or your email 
address, both of which are (usually) easy to remember.&nbsp  Of course, you'll 
have to enter the same Site ID String each time you use the tracking feature, otherwise you're defeating it's purpose.&nbsp
For that reason, I've provided the "Remember me" feature.&nbsp  If "Remember me" is checked, the site will drop a cookie
containing your Site ID String onto your machine.&nbsp (If you subsequently log on from a different machine, or the cookie
can not otherwise be found, you will, of course, have to re-enter your Site ID String.)&nbsp If "Remember me" is not checked, the site will not drop such a
cookie -- in fact, it will attempt to remove any cookie that it may have previously dropped onto your machine.</p>
<p>Immediately after processing the "Remember me" feature, your Site ID String gets hashed (read on).&nbsp I
only store the hashed version in the site's database.&nbsp If you use your email address as your Site ID String, I will
not use it to send you email, nor will I release it to anyone else.</p>
<h3>Hashing algorithm</h3>
<p>Site ID Strings submitted to this site never actually get stored on the server.&nbsp Instead, a Site ID String such as "user@domain.com" immediately gets
converted to something like "92d2ed12dcb2cce2cc92f0200200c04fe" before I store it anywhere.&nbsp I use a popular one-way hashing algorithm called "MD5" to accomplish such conversion.&nbsp; The algorithm is called "one-way" because, although the scrambling operation is quick and easy, the reciprocal operation (unscrambling) is believed to require tremendous amounts of time and computing power.</p>
