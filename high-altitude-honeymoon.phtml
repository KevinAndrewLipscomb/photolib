<center><hr></center>
<P><? PutLibPhoto("2001-006","027","left"); ?>Little did Rebecca or I know, when we planned our honeymoon three months prior, what exactly would transpire during that fateful week after our wedding.&nbsp; We are home safe and sound now, and we've settled back into our routine.&nbsp; Our cat, Sasquatch, behaves as if nothing particluarly strange occurred during the week that she was without us.&nbsp; Little does she know.</p>
<p>Our flight out of Norfolk the morning after the wedding had a scheduled take-off time of 6:10 A.M.&nbsp; Being in our respective assigned places at 6:10 is not altogether unusual for Rebecca nor for me, but we are <i>not</i> accustomed to being on a jet airliner at 6:10 after an evening wedding.</p>
<p>We were headed to Vail, Colorado.  We had done a good job of packing beforehand.  Before we left the house, I put the nozzle on the garden hose and sprayed the "Just Married" messages off of the Lincoln Town Car that I'd rented for the wedding.  That was uneventful, as I think the substance that Shawn and Lisa chose to decorate the car with was soap.</p>
<p>We said goodbye to Sasquatch and piled everything into Rebecca's Explorer:  Five bags to check, including Rebecca's skis, and two carry-ons.  I drove the Lincoln and Rebecca followed.  Our first task at the airport was to drop off the Lincoln.  I had not really topped off the fuel tank (I had only put about 25 miles on the odometer), but I said I had.  I like living dangerously.</p>
<p>We parked the Explorer in the parking garage and carried our luggage through the temporary tunnel that led to the terminal.  We checked the five large bags and headed to the second floor, where we had enough time (by design) to stop at a kiosk for pastries.  That was our first breakfast.</p>
<p>At the security gate, I remembered to ask the guard to hand-check my film pouches, which he did without a fuss.  We unloaded our pockets into the tupperware cup and walked through the metal detector uneventfully.  I don't remember waiting at the gate for very long before boarding.</p>
<h3>First class seats</h3>
<p><? PutLibPhoto("2001-007","013","right"); ?>I had never flown first class before, and on this trip we would fly nothing but first class, thanks to the gratitude of Rebecca's brother Robert, who gave us the tickets.  The first hop was a short one to Charlotte on a Fokker 100.  We got bagels, fresh fruit, and drinks -- our second breakfast.  The flight and connection were unremarkable.</p>
<p><? PutLibPhoto("2001-007","011","left"); ?>The second hop would get us all the way to Denver.  This was on a roomier Airbus 300.  It had flat-panel displays that would swing down from the overhead to display safety information and the in-flight (which was <i>The Legend of Bagger Vance</i>).  We got our third breakfast on that flight, served on linen, and followed up with hot lemon-scented towels!  I got the hot plate -- an omelet, sausage, hash browns, more fresh fruit, yogurt, and a muffin.  Rebecca got the cold dish -- something other than an omelet.</p>
<p>Denver International Airport (DIA) was interesting.  I remembered the tremendous cost overruns that they'd incurred as they developed the computer-controlled baggage handling system there.  The system had been a poster child for, among other things, poor software development practices.  For us, however it worked fine.  In fact, we didn't have luggage problems at any point on the trip.</p>
<p>Our favorite part of DIA was the talking subway system.  The system connects the airport's three remotely-located concourses with each other and with the main terminal building.  Before speaking an instruction to its passengers, the subway's speakers would play one of several silly little musical phrases.  I suppose these two-to-three second interludes were designed to cut through whatever other chatter or boom-box noise the passengers may be introducing into the environment, but they just made Rebecca and I laugh.  We found our luggage easily, stopped by the Alamo desk to pick up the keys to our rental car, and headed to the shuttle lanes.  An Alamo shuttle bus brought us and our luggage a mile or two out to the rental car lot, where we picked up the car after reminding the staff that we'd arranged to have a ski rack installed on the roof.</p>
<p>From Denver, it's about a two-hour drive to Vail.  Vail itself is built right up against the interstate, but its coziness isn't apparent from the highway.  In these parts that the locals call the "high country" of Colorado, they use traffic circles (roundabouts) at the bottom of every interstate junction.  After literally driving around in circles and making a brief stop at the visitor's center, we arrived at the Sonnenalp at around 12:30 P.M. MST -- three and a half hours before check-in time.</p>
<h3>Let the tipping commence!</h3>
<p><? PutLibPhoto("2001-006","024","right"); ?>Rebecca went in to see if our room was ready, and I stayed with the car.  I was pleasantly surprised to see her signalling to me to from inside to have everything brought in.  The valet and the bellboy took charge, and we were in our suite in no time.  The staff had already delivered the flowers, fruit & cheese basket, champagne, and chocolate-covered strawberries for which I'd arranged.  I made the bellboy work for his tip by making him fill up our ice bucket.</p>
<p>Of course, we took some time to check out our suite at that point.  Gas fireplace, king-sized bed, cozy sitting area, TV, VCR, "mini bar", and large closets; heated bathroom floor, dual sinks, large bathtub and separate shower; terrycloth robes and slippers, safe, clothes iron and ironing board; and a view of the stream that runs through the village, and of the mountains.  We'd made a good choice.</p>
<br clear=both>
<p align=center><? PutLibPhoto("2001-007","073"); echo " "; PutLibPhoto("2001-007","078"); ?></p>
<p>At some point, we walked around the hotel to check out its amenities.  It had what amounted to a parlor; a library; a fine-dining restaurant; a game room; two internet-connected computers; and a spa with a heated indoor/outdoor pool, indoor and outdoor jacuzzi/hot tubs, a workout room, a bar, and a circular fireplace surrounded by sofa benches.  The spa also had massage and mud bath areas, but we didn't explore those parts.  Clean towels were never more than ten paces away.</p>
<p>Our next task was to pick up my rental ski equipment.  We stopped at the concierge desk for directions and a walking map and headed out.  The village has plenty of pedestrian space, and wasn't crowded while we were there.  We soon found the skip shop and claimed the rental equipment.  Since we had decided not to ski until the next day, the shop staff offered to store our equipment there until we came for it.  "What's the charge for that?", I asked.  "Nothing."  I was pleasantly surprised.  Several things pleasantly surprised me on our honeymoon, but most consumer-related surprises were associated with high payments.  This was one of only two events that came across to me as a deal.</p>
<p><? PutLibPhoto("2001-007","018","right"); ?><? PutLibPhoto("2001-007","014","right"); ?>We did some window shopping and headed back to the hotel.  After having some champagne, the relaxation and tiredness set in, and I decided to nap.  Rebecca started off reading, but apparently ended up napping with me in short order.  Our plan was to wake up for dinner, but that didn't happen.  Instead we woke up, in our clothes, at about 5:00 A.M. (7:00 A.M. EST) the next morning. We changed into Sonnenalp robes and called room service for breakfast.  Looking in the mirror, I saw that eleven hours of sleep had not reduced the bags under my eyes.  By the time we'd finished our breakfast in bed and read the New York Times, the sun was painting the slopes in a soft gold light.</p>
<h3>Time to hit the slopes</h3>
<p>Now it was Monday.  We spent the day skiing.  I skied amateurishly.  It turned out that I'd selected boots that were a little too large, and skis that were a little too long.  Rebecca skied much better, but said she didn't feel up to par.  We had lunch at the current incarnation of the Two Elks Lodge, at the top of one of the mountains.  The original Two Elks Lodge was burned to the ground by environmental activists several years prior.  I didn't take any pictures on the slopes until later in the week.  By the end of the day, it was evident that we'd neglected to use any sunscreen.  At 11,000 feet, that's a mistake no matter how bundled up you are.</p>
<p>That night we had dinner at one of the two restaurants owned by the Sonnenalp called the Swiss Chalet.  They serve everything fondue-style there.  Rebecca had never had fondue before.  You would've thought Rebecca had never been served a bottle of wine before, either.  When the waiter showed us the label, Rebecca said, accurately, "We don't know what we're looking at, but it looks fine to us."  When the waiter poured the first glass for Rebecca, she proceeded to chug down the first mouthful without pause, and when we were getting ready to leave, she gave the waiter and I a chuckle by asking if we could take the bottle with us.  My tip probably paid the waiter's car loan installment.</p>
<p>Tuesday morning we stopped at the place where I'd rented my ski equipment so that I could exchange my skis and boots for smaller sizes.  I still skied amateurishly that day, but I could tell that the shorter sizes were better for me.  I was still gravitating toward the easy trails (or rather toward the bottoms of the mountains <i>via</i> the easy trails), so much so that Rebecca had to resort to using her feminine wiles (which will not be fully disclosed here -- suffice it to say that this was, after all, our honeymoon) to entice me to try the diamond trails.  Low clouds and heavy snow came in shortly after lunch, so we made it a short day on the slopes.</p>
<p><? PutLibPhoto("2001-006","025","left"); ?>Later that afternoon, we decided to spend some money in the stores where we had previously just window-shopped.  We happened upon a photography store that was going out of business (for reasons unknown), and picked up some great deals.  In an everything-for-two-dollars grab-bin, I found a special vertical shutter release accessory for my MD-12 motor drives that would normally go for $43 at B&H!  In the same $2 bin, Rebecca got a shoulder holster for our FRS radios.  The same item, brand new, was hanging on the wall for $16, which is what I paid so that we would have communications-fashion-parity.  We also picked up a tabletop tripod for Rebecca and a killer Lowepro fanny-pack-inspired camera bag that would hold both my camera bodies and three lenses, one of which could be my big 200-400 zoom.  I could take this skiing!  Overall, our purchases at this store amounted to the second of the two "deals" that we encountered on this trip.</p>
<p>That evening we had dinner at an Italian place called Vendettas.  We had fun listening to a group of young Australians at a nearby table, and we talked about reserving spots on a snowmobile tour for Wednesday.  I thought it would be good to give our muscles a break from skiing, and Rebecca looked forward to the variety.  Back at the hotel, we rented <i>Space Cowboys</i> on video for only $8.  The film's producers have their marketing folks rather than the director or screen writer to thank for the movie's popularity.</p>
<p>Wednesday morning, we learned that no snowmobiles would be available until the next day.  I still wanted to give my muscles a break, so we decided to do some sightseeing in our rental car.  We took I-70 west until we realized we had passed our intended exit.  Two roundabouts later, we were eastbound again.  Just as we approached our exit, we saw a pedestrian motioning his hands as if he were pushing something in front of him down from chest-level to waist-level.  He wanted traffic to slow down, and as I committed our car to the exit ramp, I saw that if I had continued east, I would've been crossing a curved, iced-up bridge.  At the far end of the bridge, at least one car had run off the road and into an embankment.  I said to Rebecca that it didn't look too bad, and kept going.  In Colorado, we were just basic EMTs anyway -- our paramedic privileges aren't legally recognized outside of Virginia Beach -- and the only medical equipment we had with us was a pair of CPR mouth shields.  Several minutes later, we heard a radio DJ say there had been a major accident involving an overturned vehicle at that very spot.  I wasn't sure if the DJ was reporting an exaggeration, if my eyes had played a trick on me, or if a subsequent, more severe accident had happened after we drove by.</p>
<p><? PutLibPhoto("2001-006","021","right"); ?>Anyway, we spent a couple of hours making a big loop on scenic highways to the southwest of Vail.  I stopped the car at an opportune spot so we could take some pictures of ourselves and the mountains.  Rebecca took a couple of shots of us using her Nikon point-and-shoot, its self-timer, and the mini-tripod that we'd bought the day before (She placed it on the car's trunk lid.)  But when I took out my Slik U-212 tripod, Nikon FE2, 19-35mm zoom lens, and Sekonic L-508 light meter, she pleaded with me not to go overboard setting up what she thought should be a simple shot.  She allowed me one shot, and then made it known that it was time to get back in the car.  That explains why I was still speaking instructions to her about where to look, and she had a look of slight impatience -- a look that says, "Oh Lord, I married a photography geek" -- on her face.</p>
<p>After our little road trip, we stopped at a grocery store to stock up on breakfast supplies.  Later, we did some shopping and then partook of the spa again.  We enjoyed sitting in the hot tub while snow fell lightly onto our faces.  The heat made me thirsty though, and while Rebecca dried off and sat at the circular fireplace to read her leisure book, I went to the bar to order a fruit smoothie -- for only $8.  What the hell, I'd saved up for it.  After napping a bit, we had a fine-dining experience at the Sonnenalp's in-house restaurant (Ludwig's), and watched <i>Erin Brockovitch</i> on the VCR.</p>
<p>This is as good a time as any to mention one of my major observations about Vail:  the ethnic arrangement.  It sure seemed to me that a large proportion of the workers that we had "face time" with were Europeans, imported no doubt because of the labor shortage.  All but one concierge were clearly European; the folks we spoke to at the front desk were European; and the folks who anwered the phone were European.  Our ski instructor (Friday) was Australian.  Our valets, bellboy, room server, and snowmobile guides (Thursday) were American.  The "back of house" folks -- maids in particular, and we understand, construction workers, were mostly Mexican, as was at least one shop cashier.  Waiters were refreshingly assorted.  So there was quite a mix, but I think it's unfortunate that roles and ethnicity seemed to be linked.</p>
<p><? PutLibPhoto("2001-007","032","left"); ?>Thursday was snowmobiling day.  The tour company picked us up at our hotel in their van, with only three others in our group.  We headed out along the same roads we had taken the day before, but this time we got history lessons from the tour guide along the way.  One of the most interesting sites was a ghost town that had been a thriving zinc mine until the EPA walked in one day gave everyone 48 hours to leave.  It took about a half an hour to reach the snowmobiling range.  The tour company provided snowsuits, helmets, and boots, and would later provide us with lunch.  Our guide gave us very clear and careful instructions on how to operate the machines, then led us out.</p>
<p>For the most part, it was a cloudy, snowy day.  We drove on a variety of terrain and trails, with four or five opportunities to stop, turn off the snowmobiles, and just take in this part of the Rockies.  The company had encouraged us to bring cameras, so I used my Lowepro bag to carry two FE2s, my three zoom lenses,and plenty of film.  I had hoped to see some wildlife, but that didn't happen.  The guide said the animals pretty much avoided humans.</p>
<p><? PutLibPhoto("2001-006","032","left"); PutLibPhoto("2001-007","072","right"); ?>At a couple of spots, our guide made offers to take pictures of me and Rebecca, which we accepted.  <i>[Note to self:  Remind casual photographers to use the entire frame for portraits.]</i></p>
<br clear=both><br>
<p>He also led us into a meadow where we didn't have to "stay within the lines".  He took the opportunity to do a little bit of showing off.</p>
<p align=center><? PutLibPhoto("2001-007","026","center"); ?></p>
<p>Next, he led us up to a peak above the timber line.  This was awesome.  We were more than 13,000 feet above sea level here.  Without walking a step, our respiratory rates were twice normal.  And it was windy...</p>
<h3><? PutLibPhoto("2001-007","068","left"); ?>Our Brush <i>With Death</i></h3>
<p>Previous guides had left long hollow plastic poles in the ground to mark where the safe ground ended and the snow cornices began.  Our guide took one of the poles and poked it into cornice territory to show us that there was nothing solid underneath, then he withdrew the pole and told us how daylight was beaming through the little tunnel that remained.  Three or four members of the group kind of jockeyed into a position to see through the little tunnel, while the tour guide used the pole to find a new firm-ground mark.  (I backed off to fiddle with my camera equipment.  The astute reader will realize that Rebecca was one of the folks closer to the edge.)  Just then, I heard one of the guys say, "Whoa!", and noticed everyone scurrying away from the cornice.  I knew what must've happened, and ran farther back myself.  <? PutLibPhoto("2001-007","071","right"); ?>Rebecca and the others said they heard a sound like a thunder clap, then noticed the snow moving beneath their feet.  The tour guide said he'd had one foot on terra firma and one on the incipient avalanche.  Though he'd been guiding for years, this was the closest he said he'd come to biting the big one.  It crossed my mind that he was the only one with a radio or a locator beacon.  We had all lucked out.</p>
<p>Once the commotion died down, I snapped a couple of pictures of the peak, nearby cornices, and Rebecca.</p>
<p>I think it was that night that we got an unexpected fireworks show.  We were back at our suite, Rebecca on the phone to her parents, when we heard about a dozen loud booms, each preceded by a bright white flash in the pitch black night.  These simple, loud explosions went on for so long that I thought perhaps this was some form of avalanche control.  Finally, the fancy colored rockets started exploding in the air.  I grabbed my camera, tripod, and lockable shutter release cord, and set up for a time exposure.  I really had little hope that I'd end up with something useful, but when I got he image back from the processor I was very pleasantly surprised.  If only I'd ended up with just a tad bit of detail in the fiery highlights...</p>
<p align=center><? PutLibPhoto("2001-007","052","center"); ?></p>
<h3>"Like a Dog in a Trash Can"</h3>
<p>Friday, we hit the slopes again, and we did what we should've done on our first day skiing.  We hired a ski instructor for the morning at the Beaver Creek ski resort, southwest of Vail.  As I mentioned before, he was Australian.  He was probably in his forties.  He spoke out of one side of his mouth, like Popeye.  We got along very well with him.</p>
<p>We hired him 70% for me, 10% for Rebecca, and 20% to familiarize us both with Beaver Creek.  After our very first downhill run, he told me that I was all over the place, "like a dog in a trash can, struggling to find any way out".  It's a grand testimonial to my personality that I took this comment constructively.  (For what we were paying him, I had damn well better feel happy about it.)<? PutLibPhoto("2001-007","079","left"); ?>  He recommended that I spend my few hours with him just following his tracks, doing some muscle learning, getting a feel for the rhythm that he said I ought to have on any kind of terrain.  I improved quickly and on subsequent runs he was able to give me some more in-depth instruction, which all helped.  He concurred that I was now on the right-sized equipment.  He convinced Rebecca to try shaped skis, which she did briefly before reverting to the straight skis that she had known and loved for so long.</p>
<p>We said goodbye to the ski instructor just before lunch, after convincing him to let us tip him.  That afternoon, finally, I was able to enjoy myself on every downhill run, thanks to a combination of better form and groomed trails.  The dark snow clouds that had been threatening all morning finally came in low in the middle of the afternoon, and we called it a day.  Before we could leave, though, Rebecca spent some time shopping for a Beaver Creek pin for her ballcap, while I took pictures.</p>

</p>
<p>Dinner that night was at the Game Creek Lodge -- a restaurant that is only accessible by gondola and snowcat.  They serve four and seven course meals.  We opted for four.  We left stuffed after having a very romantic evening.</p>
<p><? PutLibPhoto("2001-007","044","right"); ?>Saturday we were back on Vail mountain for our last day of skiing.  The lessons I'd learned the previous day stuck, including the advice to stay mostly on groomed trails.  The weather was much better on this day, too.</p>
<p>Sunday we were up at five to get out by seven to turn in the rental car by ten before our flight at 11:15.  Another very snowy day, and we were leaving satisfied.  We had a tailwind on the hop back to Charlotte, and as a result our flight time was shorter than the in-flight movie.  I guess we'll have to rent <i>Finding Forrester</i> if we are to ever Find Forrester's End.  <i>(Not!)</i>  The captain warned us of high winds in Charlotte, but they didn't bother us.  We returned to Norfolk amidst rain.</p>
<p>That's about it.  Were you expecting something dramatic, something to justify this article's introduction?&nbsp; Well, if you didn't think <i>Our Brush With Death</i> was exciting, I'm sorry to disappoint.&nbsp; But how else was I supposed to get you to read the whole thing and look at all the pictures?</p>
